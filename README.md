# Java-with-the-Programming-Panda
I'm an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineer who enjoys playing with Code. I fell in love with Java when I began to learn how to code because of its object oriented nature, and thought, "Why not create my own notes that may be easy for all to follow?" So this is what this repository is all about. Enjoy!
