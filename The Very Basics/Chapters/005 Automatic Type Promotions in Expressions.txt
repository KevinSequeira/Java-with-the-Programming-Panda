Automatic Type Promotions in Expressions:
=================================================================================

001) Type conversions can also happen in expressions.
002) Consider the following example:

byte a = 40, b = 50, c = 100;
int d = a * b / c;

003) The result of the expression a * b int type value. So Java automatically
     promotes each byte or short operand to int when evaluating its expression.

004) However, this automatic conversion can cause confusing compile-time errors.
005) For example, the seemingly correct code causes a problem:

byte b = 50;
b = b * 20;

006) The code attempts to store 50 * 2, a perfectly valid byte value back into a
     byte variable.
007) However, due to automatic type promotion, the operand has been converted to
     type int.
008) In order to assign it back into a byte variable, we would need to use a cast.

byte b = 50;
b = (byte) b * 2;
