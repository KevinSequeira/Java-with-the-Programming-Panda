# Code Blocks and Modular Coding

Hey peeps, welcome to the Second Chapter of Java with the Programming Panda! I'm glad you made it past the first chapter,
because that was the easiest thing in the whole world. And in case you forgot about the first chapter,
I urge you, <b>"Please read it. It'll help."</b>

In this chapter, we're going to visit at a really important aspect of the basics: Code Blocks.

A Code Block - more simply a 'block of code' - is any code that falls together within parenthesis. The parenthesis sets the bounds
to validity of the code. This means any code within the parenthesis is only valid within it.

A block of code may have more blocks within it. You'll see this often in the examples we're going to visit. So don't worry if this
sounds complicated now.

Code Blocks make coding easier to build and understand. It gives way to organization. Jave uses this aspect in the form of control
statements, classes, and methods:

This chapter focuses on <b>Control Statements</b>, and how they affect the execution of any program. There are two types of
control statements in Java:

1) Select Statements : if, if-else, and switch.
2) Interation Statements: while, do while, for, and for-each.

We're going to have an good, example-based approach towards learning how to use each of these in Java. I'd suggest you get started with
<b>Select Statements</b> first, and then move on to <b>Iteration Statements</b>.

Have fun!
